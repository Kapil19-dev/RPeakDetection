# RPeakDetection
ECG R-Peak and RR-interval detection and calculation


Two scripts for R-Peak Detection and to calculate de RR interval.

To test both scripts the BiospPy and the WFDB (version 1.39) libraries need to be installed. 

Both can be installed via pip or pip3 although the code was built in Python3.
